            <h1>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
            <p>Let's discuss about scope in programming refer of a program where  particular variable can accessed or modified.</p>
            <p><span>Var: </span>Var scope is different from other Var is a functional scope that means we cant access the Var form the function where the var is decleared.</p>
            <p><span>Let: </span> Let is a block scope variable that's means it is visible in scope where its define . But we can reassign it in decleard scope</p>
            <p><span>Const: </span>Const is also a block scope . it also visible in  define scope but we can't reassign it. Once the const is declear we can't  reassign it.</p>

            <h1>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
            <p><span>NULL:</span>Null is often used to explicitly represent the absence of any object value or as a placeholder for an object that doesn't exist or is not applicable.
                Example :If the user is not logged in, you could assign the value null.</p>
            <p><span>UNDEFINED:</span>Undefined indicates that a variable is not assigned a value or not declared. If a function doesn't have an explicit than the return statement returns undefine by default.
                When a function has optional parameters, and if a parameter is not provided, it is often left undefined. This allows the function to check whether a specific parameter was passed or not.</p>

            <h1>What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
            <p>RESTful APIs, short for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces, are a widely used architectural style for designing web services. They leverage standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to facilitate communication and data exchange between diverse software applications. Guided by principles such as statelessness, a uniform interface, and the use of resources identified by URIs, RESTful APIs have become a cornerstone of modern web development. Their standardized approach enables seamless integration and data sharing across various applications, fostering a more interconnected and dynamic digital ecosystem.</p>
